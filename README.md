# Halloween Crossing

Based on the first game in the tutorial linked below. 
This project is really just to get you comfortable using basiv JavaScript and Phaser3 to build your game.
As I'm just learning to code, this was a great introduction and replacing the game assets with something
less hideous than the ones icluded in the tutorial has made me want expand on this game a little.
